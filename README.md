## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Lipei Shao, a research fellow at the Center for Cellular Engineering, Clinical Center, NIH.

Here are several key takeaways about me:

I am currently working in the CAR T-cell immunotherapy field, with a focus on identifying profiles in CAR T-cell products associated with potency and clinical outcomes.

I have over 13 years of experience in molecular lab work, more than 6 years in NGS sequencing, and over 6 years in bioinformatics, which includes sequencing data analysis and data visualization.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, and reading.

For soccer, I play two games per week, covering 5-6 miles per game.

For hiking, I usually go on one day-long hike each weekend, typically covering 10-13 miles. My longest hike in a single day was 22 miles (~32 km, 50,000+ steps).

For reading, I spend about 5 hours per week on books.
