## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Lipei Shao, a researc fellow working at Center for Cellular Engineering, Clinical Center, NIH. 

Here are several takeaways for me:

--I am working on CAR T-cell immunotherapy field, focusing on identification of profiles in CAR T-cell products associated with potency and clinical outcomes.

--I have 13+ years experience in molecular lab , 6+ years experience in NGS sequencing, 6+ years experience in bioinformatics (includes sequencing data analysis and data visualization).

--After work, I love playing soccer, hiking, and reading.

For soccer, I played two games per week, 5-6 miles per game.

For hiking, I usually choose one day at weekend and take 10-13 miles. The longest distance I walked once in one day is 50,000+ steps (~32km, ~20 miles).

For reading, I usually take ~5h on reading per week.
