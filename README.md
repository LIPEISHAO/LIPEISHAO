## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Lipei Shao, a research fellow working at Center for Cellular Engineering, Clinical Center, NIH.
I am working on CAR T-cell immunotherapy field, focusing on identification of profiles in CAR T-cell products associated with potency and clinical outcomes.
I have 10+ years lab experiences, and 5+ years bioinformatic experience in sequencing data analysis and data visualization. 
After work, I love soccer, hiking, and reading.
For soccer, I played two games per week, 8-9km per game.
For hiking, I usually choose one day at weekend and take 15km-20km.
For reading, I usually take ~5h on reading per week.
